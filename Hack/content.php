                    <li><h4 class="green-text">Why</h4>
                    The Hackathon has two primary functions.  First and foremost we want to get students out of their
                    books and into a team building an actual thing!  Second, we want to connect you with companies interested
                    in hiring you!  Multiple companies will be participating and sponsoring the event so take advantage of
                    their interest!
                    </li>
                    <li><h4 class="green-text">How</h4>
                    You will form a team prior to or at the start of the hackathon.  Your team must have an idea for an app
                    (mobile or desktop), website, service, etc that would be useful to students/faculty/staff at our your school.
                    You will have exactly 24 hours to "hack-together" (hence:hackathon) a prototype or a full fledged app.  At the
                    end your team must present to a panel of judges. You have exactly 3 minutes of presentation followed by 3 minutes
                    of Q & A.<br>

                    <li><span class="green-text">TLDR:</span>
                    You.  Form team.  Build app/website/service in 24 hours.  Pitch it.  Win cash prizes! Network with companies!
