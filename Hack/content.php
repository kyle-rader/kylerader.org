            The Hackathon has two primary functions.  First and foremost we want to get students out of their
            books and into a team creating and building an thing!  Second, we want to connect you with companies interested
            in hiring you!  Multiple companies will be participating and sponsoring the event so take advantage of
            their interest!  There will be free food, conversation, and swag!
            </li>
            <li><h4 class="blue-text bold">How</h4>
            You will form a team prior to or preferably at the start of the hackathon.  Your team must have an idea for a thing
            that would be useful to students/faculty/staff at your school.  It could be a mobile app, a desktop app, a website, a
            command line program whatever you want!
            You will have exactly 24 hours to build a prototype or a full fledged app and practice pitching it.  At the
            end your team will present to a panel of judges. You have exactly 3 minutes of presentation followed by 3 minutes
            of Q & A.<br>
            </li>
            <li><span class="blue-text">TLDR:</span>
            You.  Form team.  Build app/website/service in 24 hours.  Pitch it.  Win prizes! Network with companies!
